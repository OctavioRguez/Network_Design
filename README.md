# Network Design

## Introduction

This project involves the design and configuration of a network using switches, routers and nodes.
The network involves multiples locations:
- Gda and Gda Production
- Qro and Qro Production
- Nuevo Leon
- Mexico City
- Monterrey
- Saltillo
- Silao

## Network Design

The network design involves the following components:

- Routers: There is a router for each location of the network.
- Switches: The is at least one switch for each of the locations or multiple switches could have been used for the network organization.
- Nodes: Nodes do not have configuration, but they are used to test conections between and inside locations.

## Router Configuration

The routers were configured with the following settings:
- hostname & username
- banner
- console & vty
- interfaces
- dhcp service
- routes


## Switch Configuration

The switches were configured with the following settings:
- hostname & username
- banner
- console & vty
- VLANs
- interfaces

## Testing

The network was tested by doing several network commands like `ping`, `tcp`, `ipconfig` and using the `http` protocol.
